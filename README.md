# TypeScript Type Error: Mismatched Function Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error involving type mismatches in function arguments. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but a string is passed to it in one of the calls, leading to a type error at compile time.  The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix this by using type guards or type assertions.
